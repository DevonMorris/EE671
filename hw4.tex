\begin{problem}[3-3]
  Consider the set of data
  \[ x = \{2,2.5,3,5,9\} \quad y = \{-4.2,-5.2,1,24.4\} \]
  \begin{parts}
   \part
   Make a plot of the data
   \part
   Determine the best least-squares line that fits this data and plot the line
   \part
   Assuming that the first and last points are believed to be the most accurate, formulate a weighting matrix and compute a weighted least-squares line that fits the data. Plot this line.
  \end{parts}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}[3-6]
  Formulate the regression $y \approx ce^{ax}$ as a linear regression problem, with regression parameters c and a. 
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
  The best way to make this problem linear is to take the log. Thus we have
  \[\log(y) \approx \log(c) + ax\]
  Now this problem is linear in $a$ and $\log(c)$.
  Thus we have the linear setup as
  $$
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & x_1 \\
    1 & x_2 \\
    \vdots \\
    1 & x_m
  \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \log(c) \\
    a 
  \end{bmatrix}
  +
  \begin{bmatrix}
   e_1 \\
   e_2 \\
   \vdots \\
   e_n
  \end{bmatrix}
  =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \log(y_1) \\
    \log(y_2) \\
    \vdots \\
    \log(y_m)
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$
  This can be solved using the typical normal (projection) equations. Note, there are some nuances to this problem, if you think $ce^{ax}$ is a good model candidate, the data should either all be negative or positive. If the data is all negative, the $y$ need to be negated before taking the log.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}[3-10]
Define an inner product between matrices $X$ and $Y$ as 
\[\langle X, Y\rangle = tr(XY^H)\]
Where $tr$ is the sum of the diagonal elements. We want to approximate the matrix $Y$ by the scalar linear combination of matrices $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_m$, as
\[ Y = c_1X_1 + c_2X_2 + \dots + c_mX_m + E\]
Using the orthogonality principle, determine a set of normal equations that can be used to find $c_1, c_2, \dots, c_m$ that minimize teh induced norm of $E$.
